‚ö†Ô∏è If chrome.exe is missing

That means the download was incomplete. In that case, two workarounds:

Manually download Chromium for Playwright:

Download ZIP for playwright build v1181 from here:
üëâ https://playwright.azureedge.net/builds/chromium/1181/chromium-win.zip

Extract to:
C:\Users\Administrator\AppData\Local\ms-playwright\chromium-1181\chrome-win\

Or use system-installed Chrome instead:

chrome_path = r"C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe"

with sync_playwright() as p:
    browser = p.chromium.launch(
        headless=False,
        executable_path=chrome_path
    )
